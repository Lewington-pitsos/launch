21 is a game played with a deck standard of cards.

Each player, including the dealer, is dealt 2 cards. Each player is then given
The opportunity to hit ( i.e. draw as many more cards as he or she would like)
or stay (stop hitting)

If at any point the total value of a player's hand is more than 21, that player
Is considered "bust" and loses the round. If neither player busts, both players
compare hands and the player with the highest valued hand wins (or the dealer
in the event of a tie).

The value of a hand is the total value of the cards in their hand, where

10, jack, king and queen are all equal to 10 points, and
aces are either 11 points or 1 point depending on which the player prefers.
