## Synopsis
This is a very basic, browser-based application for running small chess tournaments.

## Use
Presently the application only runs if you have google [chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) installed.

Similarly it only works on windows machines.

If neither of these is a problem, simply run `RunTourney.bat` and the application will boot up in chrome.

## Aims
This application should:
- Allow the user to easily set up and run small chess tournaments
- Be easy and intuitive to use
- Function and retain an aesthetically pleasing display on all standard devices (...that have chrome installed and run .bat files :P)
- Contain no bugs for all reasonable user inputs (including common mistakes)
- Be relatively efficient in terms of routing, sorting, etc.
